                    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                    <p>Kyle McDonald’s net artwork, “Exhausting a Crowd” is a prime example of the marvels,
capabilities, and affordances that net art provides through the medium of the internet. This
interactive artwork intersects technology and human experiences, providing viewers with a
thought-provoking, innovative, and exciting experience. In this essay, we will be diving
further into this net artwork, analyzing it and examining how this specific net artwork, along
with how net artwork in general employs the internet to create meaning, evoke emotions, and
engage with audiences.</p>
                   <h2>Internet/Web Art:</h2> 
                    <p>Upon reading the term, one would infer that net/web art is the art that is constructed and
portrayed through the internet. “Internet Art or Net Art: a form of art specifically conceived
through the internet, on the internet, and for the internet” (Ricci, 2020). According to Chatel,
network art was something that artists began exploring in the late 1970s (Chatel, 2019). The
web has been around for a long time now, and as the capabilities of the web improve, so too
do artists’ web art. Christou states that internet art is not just merely something created to
look nice, but rather, it is created and used to “explore issues relevant to all aspects of life”
(Christou, 2019). Art has often been used as a means of exploring issues and signifying and
conveying a message or meaning, and internet art is the same. The advantage that Internet art
has over normal contemporary, traditional art is that almost everyone who has access to the
internet would be able to access the internet artworks. It is not restricted or limited to fancy
museums and libraries, but rather just to the screen in front of you. Also, unlike traditional art
which is non-interactive, static, and confined to physical spaces such as museums, internet art
is interactive, dynamic, fun, and widely accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
Another characteristic and what some would term an advantage of Internet Art over
traditional art is the fact that some Internet art pieces are continuously evolving and ever-
changing based on the input/interaction of the viewers. “Exhausting a Crowd” is an example
of this, as it is continuously changing based on the inputs of the users.</p>
                   <h2>Internet As a Medium for Art:</h2>
                    <p>When the internet was first started, many people were baffled, shocked, fascinated, and
scared, similar to our reactions to the rise of AI and AI chatbots like ChatGPT in current
times. The internet was not created with its primary purpose to serve as a medium of art or a
gallery of art, rather, it was created as a means of storing and sharing information. However,
as times have changed and as technology and the internet as progressed, so too as the
functions and purposes of these mediums. Christou mentions that now, we can no longer
function without the internet and we cannot imagine a life without the internet, it is simply
part of our lives now (Christou, 2019). This also means that the internet shapes our lives and
serves as a primary source of information. With this progression of the internet and our
dependencies on the internet, some artists viewed the internet as an ideal medium for art.
They viewed the web or the internet as a “democratic and participatory space where one
could perform an innovative form of collaborative art that was also immaterial and not
mediated by institutions” (Ricci, 2020). Ricci also mentions that some of the main features of
the internet, such as hyperlinks, have become the means of expression and the subject of
internet artwork (Ricci, 2020). Unlike static traditional artworks, internet artworks exist
without material constraints and this allows artists, like Kyle McDonald to create immersive,
dynamic ever-evolving, and changing experiences that blur the lines between creator and
viewer. Like in ‘Exhausting a Crowd’, you as the viewer have the ability, through your inputs
to contribute and add to the artwork, making it an interactive and immersive experience.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Analysis of “Exhausting a Crowd”:</h2>
                        <h3>a. What is it:</h3>
                        <p>“Exhausting a Crowd” is an interactive internet artwork created by Kyle Mcdonald in
2015. The artist had recorded 12 hours of footage in various cities which includes
people passing by and engaging in day-to-day activities. The artwork allows you as
the user to add tags or comments to things/people in the video. You can also view the
tags/comments that other people have left. Mcdonald's inspiration for this artwork is
from French Writer Georges Perec’s artwork, “An Attempt at Exhausting a Place in
Paris” in which he wrote 60 pages on the minutiae that usually goes overlooked in
Saint-Sulpice Square in Paris (Meier, 2015). This artwork explores the realities of
surveillance and how we are watched/monitored both knowingly and unknowingly,
and it also explores collective intelligence. Through users annotating the footage, they
are providing information on what is or what they think is present in the footage, and
this requires analysis, interpretation, and human attention.</p>
                        
                        <h3>b. Why did I choose this:</h3>
                        <p>When searching for and going through various net/web/internet art, there weren’t
many that grabbed my attention and that I found that resonated with me or my
interests. However, upon coming across “Exhausting a Crowd”, I was immediately
amazed, intrigued, and fascinated. I’ve always loved just sitting somewhere and
observing the world pass by, taking notice of people and their interactions. This is
exactly what this art piece is. I loved how simple, yet so dynamic and deep this was.
All of it is pre-recorded video footage being played with the ability to input and
annotate notes or comments, yet it works so well together and creates something so
unique. I didn’t initially realize that I could add in comments as well, and when I did
figure that out, I didn’t realize that the comments I added would form part of the
artwork. This ever-changing and ever-evolving aspect is what really stood out to me,
and what made me feel as if I was actually an artist contributing to the art piece.</p>
                        <h3>c. How does it make use of the internet as its medium:</h3>
                        <p>As mentioned previously, the internet can serve as a great medium for artworks,
especially when the artworks make use of the affordances of the internet as a medium.
The internet as a medium of art allows artists to do things that they would not be able
to do with traditional mediums of art such as paper, canvases, etc. David Quiles
Guillo mentions that with the digital space being all around us, it provides a space to
connect to a wider audience (Burke, 2018). As I mentioned previously, internet art
can reach far wider global audiences than traditional physical art. This is because
anyone with an internet connection and access to the internet/web can view the
artwork. This is particularly important for collaborative, interactive, or audience-
input-based artworks, such as Mcdonald's ‘Exhausting a Crowd’. When more people
can access it, it allows for more input and more collaborations. If this artwork was
situated in a museum in another country, and only people who visited this museum
were able to provide inputs and annotations on the video, it would not have nearly as
many annotations as it does now. Therefore, this artwork makes use of the reach and
audience of the internet.
The internet serves as a network and platform for art in the public sphere (Burke,
2018). ‘Exhausting a Crowd’ makes use of this connected network to allow for real-
time interaction and collaboration among viewers. Users from around the world can
access this artwork and contribute and annotate their notes instantly. This sort of
engagement breaks through physical boundaries and allows for users to interact with
the artwork irrespective of where they are based in the world.
As viewers annotate the live footage with their observations and comments, a
collective narrative of the chosen footage emerges. McDonald's use of an online web-
based platform enables the continuous updating and expansion of the artwork,
reflecting the evolving nature of the observed space (Meier, 2015). This accumulation
of annotations transforms the artwork into a dynamic representation of collective
observation.
Christou states that the internet has become “an open place for community,
collaboration, creation, and exhibition” as well as “a public sphere for internet artists”
(Christou, 2019). With ‘Exhausting a Crowd’, users can share their annotated notes
and observations not only on the artwork but on social media platforms and online
forums as well. This creates a sense of community and collaboration, and it enhances
the impact, message, and significance of the artwork, just like Christou stated the
internet has become.
By using the internet as a medium for this artwork, McDonald was able to create an
exciting, unique and immersive experience which encourages users to actively
participate and engage with the artwork.</p>
                        <h3>d. Conceptual, aesthetic, and technical aspects of artwork:</h3>
                        <p>Conceptual – this artwork explores public surveillance, as well as collective
observation. It also touches on themes of privacy, ethics, consent, and the impact that
technology has on the human experience.
Aesthetic – the artwork has a very basic and minimalistic aesthetic. Only the video
footage and the annotation tool are shown, and this focuses the attention of the users
on observing the footage. The annotations are also constantly updating and this
highlights the ever-changing evolving and dynamic nature of the artwork.
Technical – as this artwork is posted through an internet medium (on a website), it has
many technical aspects. Firstly, it is an interactive website/web app that allows for
real-time user interactions/annotations. It also makes use of a database to store and
retrieve all of the annotations made. It also synchronizes the video playback, the
user’s inputs, and the updated visual display.</p>
                            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>By using the internet as a medium, McDonald was able to create an artwork that was
interactive, unique, innovative, and exciting. He was also able to blur the boundaries between
the creator and the audience, as he allowed the audience to be part of the creation through
their input. Unlike traditional static artworks, this internet artwork is ever-changing, ever-
evolving, and an example of the benefits of collaboration and audience participation.
"Exhausting a Crowd" shows how compelling internet art can create evolving, participatory
experiences that turn viewers into active co-creators alongside the artist. By allowing the
audience to get involved, it also showcases and signifies the uniquely human abilities we
have to analyse, interpret, and observe the world around us.
